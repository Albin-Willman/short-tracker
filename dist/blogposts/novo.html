<h2>First contact</h2>
<p>
  A few years ago when I was working on a startup with big pharma companies as customers. As we where trying to secure funding one of the things we wanted in our slide deck was confirmation that our market wasn't going away. So I did some reasearch mainly in order to find good sources of what we already knew: Cancer and diabetes was increasing. I found a huge amount of charts such as <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/prev/national/figpersons.htm">this</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We started collaborating with Novo Nordisk on a few projects and even if I can't describe their organization as nimble I find it a plus that they are working woth startups and trying out new products in order mitigate the problems the pharma industry is facing. There are quite a few of the other large players that are far more afraid of change.
</p>
<p>
  Back then I only started watching the company because it was interesting to see how our custommer was doing.
</p>
<h2>First entry</h2>
<p>
  A few years later when I had started doing investments I came back to Novo and bought my first shares in april and may of 2014 for around 240 DKK per share.
</p>
<p>
  My reasons for buying them where pretty much the same as every one elses. They have a great position in a market that isn't going anywhere and their customers have to come back and buy more. This combined with my observation that they seemed to be willing and able to adapt to new challenges convinced me that it would be a winner in the long run.
</p>
<h2>Exit and reentry</h2>
<p>
  As I wrote about in my <a href="http://kortapositioner.se/blog/fingerprint">post on fingerprint</a> I felt that Fingerprint cards was really under prised in june 2016. So I made a short term switch, I sold my Novo Nordisk and invested it in Fingerprintcards. This was a really lucky move as it turned out for one I was quite right when it came to Fingerprint cards I also missed the revision of the growth oulook that made Novo Nordisk fall from 380 DKK to 300 DKK.
</p>
<p>
  I felt that the fall was a bit over the top so I made my reentry in Novo Nordisk a little bit to early at 320 DKK but still I am not complaining.
</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>
  My intention is and has been all the time to keep my shares for a really long time. As long as noone invents an actual cure for diabetes or a competetor comes up with something incredible I think this will stay in my portfolio.
</p>
<p>
  These are my reasons for owning shares in Novo Nordisk AS and it is in no way meant as a recomandation for any one else to do it. Please do your own due diligence before making any investments.
