<h2>Version 2 is Live!</h2>
<p>
  I am posting this post with the same command as I am releasing version 2 of kortappositioner.se! There are a few small changes and one new feature. Hopefully you will like it.
</p>
<p>
  I already wrote a litte bit about this last weekend but here it comes:
</p>

<h3>Shorters</h3>

<p>
  It is now possible to see short positions grouped by the entity that has taken them. This might be a way to get a feel for what major players think of areas.
</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>
  All charts now contain one datapoint per date within the relevant span. This makes loading a little bit slower but it gives a better perspective and the graphs over stock prices looks more like they do in other places. I have tried to mitigate the extra data amount by making more computations in advance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Zoomable charts</strong>, it is now possible to zoom in all charts if you only are intrested in a subset of the dates.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Automatically updated data</strong>, now there is a heroku instance automatically updateing the data. Hopefully you wonÂ´t notice this change but I think it will make the service a little bit more reliable.
</p>
