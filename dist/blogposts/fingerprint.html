<h2>How it began</h2>
<p>
  I graduated from university in the summer of 2011 and my first job did not carry a huge paycheck. In fact
  I started working for a small startup (in Lund, Sweden) that could barely afford to pay me. The job however was really interesting and it seemed like a good time to take a risk. In the autumn of 2012 the startup got some venture capital and
  I started getting a more "normal" salary.
</p>
<p>
  There was quite a buzz around Precise Biometrics in Lund at that time Apple was just about to buy Authentec and
  the biometric market was in my opinion about to explode so I took my first real salary and invested it in Precise Biometric.
  After I made the investment I started hanging around in different online forums and educated myself as to what I had
  bought(In more resent investments I made I try to do it the other way around read first buy second). It was reading about Precise I started learning about Fingerprint Cards.
</p>
<p>
  The more I read the more obvious it seemed that Fingerprint Cards was the better and safer bet. On Valentines day 2013 (2013-02-14) I sold my Precise and bought Fingerprint. The price I bought them for was 22.15 SEK (4.43 SEK if compared with after split). My main reasons for buying the stock back then was:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>I did not see any real competition</li>
  <li>Their technology seemed cool</li>
  <li>Their IP seemed solid</li>
  <li>If Apple was incorporating fingerprint sensors Android would have to follow</li>
</ol>

<h2>My first year as a Fing Fan</h2>
<p>
  Once I had bought my first shares and earned my first 50% (the rise up past 30 SEK was almost instant) I became even more
  infatuated by the stock. I bought more shares for 34 SEK and for 50 SEK and in september of 2013 for 81 SEK...
</p>
<p>
  Then the stock started falling, and fell back down to around 50 SEK which in my opinion was really strange since the company kept publishing news about "design wins" and in any way I looked at it everything seemed to be going great. So I invested a bit more. But at this point I was a bit worried, what did the see that I was missing?
</p>
<h2>The hard descision</h2>
<p>
  September 11th 2014 the news about the trial against Johan Carlström for insider trading. The stock droped like a stone at the bottom it was down 40% in one day. All of my profit was gone and I was sitting with my finger hovering above the "sell" button. But I never pressed it. Instead I took a step back and asked myself: What possible inpact could this have on the company. I identified one major risk and that was that potential customers might feel that Fingerprint Cards was not serious. I took this risk into account but decided that the market was heavily overreacting so instead of selling I bought
</p>
<p>
  By the end of 2014 I had investeed almost 90% of my financial assets in Fingerprint Cards and this was to be honest a bit more than I was comfortable with from a risk managemanet perspecitve. So when the stock started moving upwards in march I started to downsize my position. During 2015 I more or less followed thee rule: Every time the stock doubled I sold a portion of my position. In retrospect it would of course have been better to keep it all and sell it att 670 SEK then buy it back for half that.
</p>
<h2>My current position</h2>
<p>
  Since may the stock has taken a quite brutal beating. When it fell bellow 100 SEK (post split price) I had the same feeling as when it fell from 80 to 50 back in 2013. I felt that it was completly unmotivated and that given repurchase program and all the money the company was making it seemed impossible for it to go down much more. So I started buying again and bought (in relation to my personal economy) a fair amount in the interval 97-104 SEK.
</p>
<p>
  I found it perplexing that changing CEO would have such a huge effect on the valuation of the company. Especially since it looked to me like the basis for the decision to switch was offensive. Noone was unhappy with Jörgen but they had managed to find an even better alternative. At least that was my take on it.
</p>
<p>
  Then the stock fell some more and then brexit happend and BAM Fingerprint was traded in the low 70s. That was according to my calculations equivalent of a PE below 10 for the current year. That was not a reasonable to me so I found myself once again 90% invested in Fingerprint cards. Writing these words I have started downsizing again and are at the moment around 75% and I intent to let a few more go in the range 115-120 SEK.
</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>
  I try to keep the reasons I had for taking a position in mind and be vary if any of them changes. So let's review the reasons I hade for buying:
</p>
<h3>Old reasons</h3>
<h4>I did not see any real competition</h4>
<p>
  There is some serious debate going on regarding this. Some analysts are saying that the competion is getting harder fast and that it will be hard for Fingerprint Cards to keep it's margins. I personally do not see it quite that way. To me it seems that the competition is struggeling. Synaptics are having issues with performance but I think their relationship with Samsung is strong enough for them to keep them as a customer. Goodix has issues with their IP-portfolio, this discourages potetial customers.
</p>
<p>
  The norwiegan companies Idex and Next are revenue wise 18 month behind Fingerprint, this makes it much harder for them to make the investments necessary to keep up with the market.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, based on the information I have available I have a hard time beliving that any of the compettetors will knock out Fingerprint. Sure they might take a portion of the market but I think Fingerprint will keep it's place as market leader. I also think that it is healthy Fingerprint in the long run with some competition, this will force them to keep develop new products and keep pushing the edge of biometric identification forwards.
</p>
<h4>Their technology seemed cool</h4>
<p>
  Maybe I would phrase it differently if I wrote it today but the geist it of it still rings true today. Their sensor is the fastest on the market. Their energy consumption seems to be the best. There has been far fewer reports of people cracking teir sensors (none that I know of regarding their sensors with live detection). This last fact might partly be due to it being much cooler to break in to an iPhone or a Samsung phone than a Vivo.
</p>
<h4>Their IP seemed solid</h4>
<p>
  To me it still does. There are no suits against to my knowledge and they are filing for new patents on a regular basis.
</p>
<h4>If Apple was incorporating fingerprint sensors Android would have to follow</h4>
<p>
  Well... That happened.
</p>

<h3>New Reasons</h3>
As well as my original reasons I have found a few more along the way.
<h4>Smart cards</h4>
<p>
  There seems to be a lot going on in this department. Their work with Zwipe and Mastercard has great potential and it seems to be happening. Personally I have three paymentcards in my wallet and I replace each of those cards at least twice for each time I buy a phone. This might be partly due to me switching bank as soon as I am offered better terms somewhere else. But still, this market should be at least as large as the smartphone market within a few years.
</p>
<p>
  The threat I see against this market is the smartphone. A possible route to putting sensors in the cards could be to discard the cards and pay with the phone instead. But I think Visa and Mastercard will work against this happening. It will be much harder for them to controll all payments if they move in to the cloud.
</p>
<h4>Internet of Things</h4>
<p>
  I am not super optimistic about the internet of things. At least not in the next five years. The problem being solved by the internet of things has not quite been invented yet. I am more or less certain that it will happen but I do not think that anyone knows how it will look quite yet and I am not sure if there will be fingerprint sensors everywhere.
</p>
<h4>Automotive</h4>
<p>
  In this department I see the benefit to the industry. It is easier for the consumer to not keep track of keys and you can adjust seats to personal settings as soon as someone grabs the door. The downside to this market is size, there are not nearly as many cars being made as smartphones or payment cards. And even if each car is fitted with more than one sensor I have a hard time imagening it growing to the same size.
</p>
<p>
  A good thing about cars is that they have much longer lifecycles meaning that if you have managed to become an integrated component in a car you should have a steady easily visible revenue stream for multiple years.
</p>
<h4>Cash flow</h4>
<p>
  When I started investing in Fingerprint Cards they did not make any money. Now they do, they make quite a lot of money, this opens up a lot of opportunities. They are able to make acquisitions and can invest mmore in research and development as well as sales. This should help them keep their position as market leader.
</p>
<h2>Threats</h2>
<p>
  There are of course threats and unkowns that might make this a bad or even really bad investment. I will try to map out a few of the things I try to keep an eye on.
</p>
<h4>New technology</h4>
<p>
  Even if Fingerprint Cards stay in the lead when it comes to fingerprint sensors there is no natural law saying that fingerprint sensors will be the solution of choice for ever.
</p>
<p>
  Tomorrow there might be some new more secure, faster, easier and cheaper tech that solves the same problems. It might be iris-scanners or DNA-scaning or a small robot that automatically calls your grandmother and asks if this really is you. I have no idea and that is exactly the point. But technology is a fast moving field so I try to keep track of new potentail options. Who knows I might find the next Fingerprint ;)
</p>
<h4>Competition</h4>
<p>
  Even if I at the moment am quite happy with the market situation I watch it closely and try to keep track of what other actors and the market are doing.
</p>

<h2>A word for the road</h2>
<p>
  This post is in no way meant to be a recomendation, I have no idea in what direction the price will go when the stock exchange opens on monday morning. Do your own homework before making any investments!
