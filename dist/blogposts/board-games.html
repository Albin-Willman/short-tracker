<h2>Resource management games</h2>

<p>
  I have been playing board games for as long as I can remember. It has been all kinds of games from the classics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess" target="_blank">Chess</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" target="_blank">Go</a> to more advanced niche games like <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126042/nations" target="_blank">Nations</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Havre_(board_game)" target="_blank">Le Havre</a> and probably everything in between. The games I enjoy the most have one theme in common: <strong>Resource management</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  In most such games you have a set resources and a number of possible actions. What actions other players select has impact on the outcome of the actions you select. Some actions requires that you invest resources.
</p>
<h2>A good school</h2>
<p>
  I think that my history of maximizing my resources in board games has been a good and entertaining school preparing me well for managing my own economy with a good risk/reward perspective. I have gotten crash courses in quite a few important fields such as how monopolies can change prices and how abusing such market position tend to come back and bite you later on.
</p>
<h2>Real life</h2>
<p>
  I find that real world economics is the same only on a slightly larger scale, longer time horizon and the fact that not everybody starts out with the same set of resources. But the principles are the same. I view each day as a turn in the game of finance. Most turns I select to make the same action spend my time resources by going to work and my financial resources are allocated the same as the previous day.
</p>
<p>
  There are two main costs to changing how I deploy my financial resources:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Time to find new options</li>
  <li>Brokerage cost</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Since I am yet to be infinitely rich (or even close to it) the second cost matters quite a lot. Especially if I were to make a lot of changes. And spending to little time on the first cost will most likely end up with me making bad decisions and paying extra money for bad investments.
</p>

<h2>Differences in strategy</h2>
<p>
  One big difference between how I play in the games as towards how I manage my financial life is that I do not play to win in real life. Instead I play to get a good result, if I was playing to win a quick analysis would tell me that my only option would be to take on enormous risk in order to start catching up to other players. The downside of losing is considerably more palpable.
