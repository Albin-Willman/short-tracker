<h2>Serendipity</h2>
<p>
  I did not participate in Tobiis IPO it did however happen the same week as I got a godson whose name is Tobias. In August 2015 it was time for his baptism I figured it would be a nice gift to start a small portfolio for him. I wanted to invest in a smaller tech company that had potential to do cool stuff over the next 20 years. It would be optimal if it would be in products that he will use when he is 12 so he can brag for his friends about being an owner.
</p>
<p>
  The similarity between his name and Tobii and the proximity in time between their IPO and his birth draw my focus to Tobii. So I started reading a little bit about them. I liked the fact that they had two branches (Tobii Dynavox and Tobii Pro) that was actually making money, even if the money they made did not cover all of their investments in Tobii Tech it felt I took it as a verification that their technology was good enough to get custommers. And with the existance of Tobii Tech which had nice potential it seemed to fit most of the criteria I had set up.

<p>
  So I bought a few shares for my godson and figured I had to put my money where my mouth was so I bought a little bit for myself as well. I made my entry around 50 SEK and the first thing that happens is that it falls almost 20%. I think I had lost 10% of the gift before the baptism... That did not feel great but on the other hand the investment horizon was 20 years not 4 days.

<h2>The last year</h2>
<p>
  You can view the year that has been since I made the investment from two perspectives. What has happened to the stock and what has happened in the company.
</p>
<p>
  Looking at the stock price it would seem that the last year has been quite dramatic. A fast rice up to 80 SEK then falling back towards 60 before sky rocketing to 87 just to collapse back down again before starting a more stable incline. It has been intresting to follow but a little bit puzzling due to my view on what has happened in the company.
</p>
<p>
  As far as I can tell not much unexpected stuff happened in the period August 2015 - August 2016. The company delivered the same type of quarterly reports as before: Earning a little bit of money from Dynavox and Pro and investing a lot in Tech. This was exactly what I was expecting and hoping for but to my mind no reason for the stock price to go bananas.
</p>
<h2>September 2016</h2>
<p>
  With the start of september however the company released some exciting news. Orders from Acer and Dell regarding integrated eye tracking in highend gameing computers. Even if the amounts that Tobii will be able to invoice based on these orders won't be astronomical I think it marks a starting point.
</p>
<p>
  It seems to me that Tobii Tech hopefully will be able to pull its own weight.
</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>
  I think there are similarities between computers and cars in some ways. I think what is custom features in highend products will soon be standard in high end and custom in the mid range, and then it trickles down and becomes standard all over the place. At least if the feature brings something to the table.
</p>
<p>
  This is what I hope will happen with eye tracking in computer screens. I think that cool and nifty things can be achieved be developers all over the world if they had a nice eye tracking api built in to computers.
</p>
<p>
  The evaluation if Tobii is quite high at and they need to make a lot of money to fill those shoes but I think they are positioned nicely and there is always the possibility of someone with a little bit of cash buying them.
