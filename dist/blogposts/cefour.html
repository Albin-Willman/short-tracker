<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>
  I came in contact with Cefour AB in early 2013, if I don't missremember it made a fast journey from 0.10 SEK to 0.20 SEK and the stock seemed interesting. I invested purchased a bit for 0.18 and sold them again a day or two later for 0.23. I was super happy with my profit and had a nice feeling about Cefour. Their solution seemed scalable and they had a few contracts coming down the pipe so a week or so later when the stock came back down to 0.19 I invested again.
</p>
<p>
  Note that Cefour has made a reversed split 50:1 in 2014 so 0.20 SEK is corresponding to 10 SEK. (For referrence last payed price 2016-08-15: 0.09 SEK down ~99% since my first entry)
</p>

<h2>The offer Acquisition</h2>
<p>
  In the summer of 2013 the company made a few pressreleases about a croatian company that according to the releases where intressted of acquisitioning Cefour for about 0.40-0.45 SEK/share. Of course the price of the wen up and I felt like I made a great buy when I managed to get my hands on a few more shares for "only" 0.27 SEK.
</p>
<p>
  It is still a bit unclear if there ever was a croatian company at all. What is 100% certain is that Cefour was never sold for 0.4 SEK. But a few of the more influential investors in Cefour did sell a large portion of their shares in connection with the pressreleases. When this became public knowledge the price of the stock droped like a stone all trade in the stock was suspended.
</p>
<p>
  There was a period of chaos when the entire Board of directors was replaced and when the dust settled it turned out that Cefour was almost bankrupt.
</p>
<h2>Uphill from here?</h2>
<p>
  My position in cefour was down 70-80% and they had to issue new shares to survive. I felt like I had two options participate and buy more shares or cut my losses. I decided two participate for three reasons.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>To my mind the beating the stock had taken due to the circus around the croatian company was a bit exessive.</li>
  <li>I did not like the idea of taking the loss. The amount of money it would have freed up was minor anyway.</li>
  <li>We have a concept in sweden called <a href="http://www.skatteverket.se/privat/skatter/vardepapper/investeraravdrag.4.10cbb69314111c2d94ba38b.html" target="_blank">Investerar avdrag (link in swedish)</a> which would give me tax benefits if I participated.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  For the same resons I came to participate in another issue of new shares later in 2014.
</p>
<h2>Downhill it went</h2>
<p>
  Needless to say if you look at a chart of the stockprice I was wrong. It went straight in the other direction, by now I have been following Cefour for three years now and I am not super optimistic about me making my money back.
</p>
<p>
  You might ask why I would keep my shares given my opinion. The answer is simply: Tax reasons, one of the terms in the "Investeraravdrag" is that you should keep the shares purchesed in the emisson for at least 5 years or you have to repay the tax benefits you recieved. At the current price if I sold my shares I would end up owing the swedish government more in tax than I would recive from selling. So they stay in my account as a reminder of bad decisions I made when I was younger and more foolish (I hope).
</p>
<p>
  This has hands down been my worst investment to date and the nice red number next to the value is -97.1% as I am writing this. But how fun would this be if you always where right? And I am happy I made this misstake at age 26 instead of 62 when i am about to retire. Of course there is no guarantee that I won't make the same misstake at age 62...
