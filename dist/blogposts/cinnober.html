<h2>First contact</h2>
<p>
  My first contact with cinnober was very recently. I heard of them in the podcast <a href="http://borspodden.se/" target="_blank">Börspodden</a> when their CEO Veronica Augustsson participated in the pod and gave an explanation of the company. I was immediately impressed by her description of their solution from a technical perspective.
</p>
<p>
  From the brief description in that pod it seemed as if their solution was far better and more flexible than anything their competetors had to offer. I, unlike everyone else, likes companies that has a product that is superior to their competition. Of course at this point I only had the word of their CEO as a source for this, what is she supposed to say? "We are not as good"? But the fact that she said that no one else even had a real time system was enough to spark my intereset. I did a little bit of searching online just to make myself a little bit more confident and nothing poped out.
</p>
<h2>The good stuff</h2>
<h3>Sales cycle</h3>
<p>
  Cinnober has a very long sales period they are selling large systems that are sensitive and their customers need time for integration and for updating policies and practices. I view this as a good thing. The reason I view it this way is that once they have managed to make a sell it is unlikely that that custommer is going away anytime soon. And once the inital investment of installing the system is done they have a long running support contract with better margins that brings a steady flow of cash. This makes it probable that they at least won't shrink.
</p>
<h3>Latency is so 1990</h3>
<p>
  To me it feels obvious that a real time system will beat a system with up to 3 days latency. This does not mean that it will happen this year or that it will be Cinnober delivering the "winning" system in the end. But to me it seems they have a nice position in a industry that is going to become a reality within the next 10 years.
</p>
<h3>Dividend</h3>
<p>
  I do not excpect this stock to take of like a rocket tomorrow so while I wait it is nice to get a little bit of dividend in the mean time. Based on closing price on 2016-08-15 (166 SEK) and the dividend of 2016 (2 SEK) it yields a whopping 1.2% which is not much but it is more than 0 :)
</p>
<h2>The less good stuff</h2>
<h3>Stock liquidity</h3>
<p>
  The activity in the stock is quite limited, the total turnover in the stock is usually below 1 000 000 SEK/day. So if I decide to sell the same day as someone else with more money their inpact to the price might be significant.
</p>
<h3>Low EBIT</h3>
<p>
  They are note making a lot of money. In Q1 they had an EBIT of 1.7 milion SEK which isn't a lot. But it is more than 0 and the fact that they are earning money means that they can afford to have long sales cycles.
</p>

<h2>Entry</h2>
<p>
  Based on the above and my gut feeling I decided to purchase some stock in Cinnober. I made the decision on the 11th when the price was 143 SEK and just needed to free up some cash and get it transfered to my trading account. I made a small entry on the 15th at 160 SEK. The position amount to 2-3% of my portfolio.
</p>

<h2>Horizion</h2>
<p>
  As I stated when listing the pros I see this quite long term. I do not know if the price will be 100 SEK or 200 SEK in three weeks time, and frankly I do not care. My horizon for this investment is 5+ years at least and what I hope to see in the mean time is a steady flow of new systems being sold.
