<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  I have been investing in the stock market since the fall of 2012 and my interest in all things related has been growing steadily ever since.
</p>
<p>
  In early 2014 I started listening to poddcasts discussing the subject and one of the ones I grew fond of was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sparpodden" target="_blank">Sparpodden</a>. In the early epsiodes of this poddcast one of the participatns was called Günther Mårder and he described how he saw life. According to his view life was built on three pillars: The personal pillar, the professional pillar and the financial pillar. The fact that the possible yield is larger the more risk you take is true for all of these pillars and the total risk in your life is a sum of how much risk you currently are takeing in each of the pillars. I find this model of life quite good and applicable.
</p>
<p>
  In order for a person to feel successful that person needs to be somewhat accomplished on all pillars and have at least one pillar that stands out.
</p>
<p>
  Given this model the main focus of this post should be the financial piller that is why I will start with brief looks at the other two pillars.
</p>

<h4>Personal pillar</h4>
<p>
  As far as I can tell this pillar is very solid, I am happily married, have a good bunch of close friends that I feel I can rely on and great relationships with both my parents and my wifes parents. The amount of risk I currently taking on this pillar is almost negligible.
</p>
<h4>Professional pillar</h4>
<p>
  I am currently working as a consulting webdeveloper via one of the larger consultancy firms in sweden. The demand for the services we suply seem quite solid at the moment and the last time I was looking for job it took less than a week to get my first offer. The combination of my solid education and how the market for web developers have been developing the last five years make me quite confident that I will be able to find a new job if I should need on.
</p>
<p>
  I would say that the risk in my professional pillar is quite low as well at the moment.
</p>

<h3>The financial pillar</h3>
<p>
  With the other two pillars being so solid I feel I can afford to amp up the risk in my investments. Another fact making me comfortable with investing with high risk is the fact that I am 29 years old and I am probalby going to be working for 40-50 years more, if I where to loose my entire life savings today it still would be a quite small portion of all the money I am going to handle through out my life.
</p>
<p>
  For the time being I view my investing as a hobby, it is something I "spend" money on. I do not invest any money I need for my day to day life and I do not intend to use the money in my investments for anything but neew investments during the next 5-10 years.
</p>
<h4>My portfolio</h4>
<p>
  I mainly invest in smaller companies working in technology or medicine. The reason I focus on those two fields is that I feel like I have a bit of an understanding of how they work. At my previous job I was working with developing software for the pharma-industry. I got to work with several companies in a wide range of sizes. From small companies conducting one phase II study for a single product hoping to be bought by one of the large ones to the actual large ones.
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays I try to make my investments as soon as I make the decision. I do this for two reasons:
  <ol>
    <li>I am inpatent</li>
    <li>I suck at timeing</li>
  </ol>
  Earlier I tried to find a company I wanted to invest in and then wait for a dip and try to time my entry. I think I managed to do this maybe 25% of the time. Then there was 25% of the time where I after a while just made the investment at about the same price but a week or to after I made the decision. That leaves about 50% of the time where I "had to" buy my share more expensive.
</p>
<p>
  I still think that timeing is a good way to improve your performance and I am trying to analyze and learn so that in the future I might become good at timeing.
</p>
<h4>Going forward</h4>
<p>
  I am very unsure about which direction the market will take when the summer come to an end. So I intend to reduce my risk at least a little bit over the coming weeks. And at least in theory I really like the concept of a dividend yielding money making machine that just keeps churning. But I feel like a lot of the stocks I would put in such machine are priced very high at this moment.
